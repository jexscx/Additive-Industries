To adjust to the needs of the future of Additive industries, we've build an application where you can track the progress of numerous machines though a device. We've build the app where you can use the application on any device to your liking: mobile, desktop or browser. Choose your weapon! To learn how we invented this, visit our design researches:

### Built With

We've build the app in Flutter: a framework where you can code crossplatform solutions. We've used Flutter mainly because we can code native apps for both Android and iOS at the same time.
